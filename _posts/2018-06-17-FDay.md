I was hoping to install a [cheap GPU](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AY7UXLE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) with my kids in an old computer they use today. However, unfortunately a [WiFi Thermostat install](https://sensicomfort.com/shop/products/thermostats/wi-fi-thermostat) took longer than expected due to wiring issues. So hopefully sometime this week.
